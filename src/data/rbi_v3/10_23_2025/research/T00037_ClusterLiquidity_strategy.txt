STRATEGY_NAME: ClusterLiquidity

STRATEGY_DETAILS:

### Overview
ClusterLiquidity is a breakout strategy designed to identify and capitalize on potential liquidity-driven price movements in financial markets (e.g., forex, stocks, or cryptocurrencies). It leverages volume clusters—high-volume nodes or areas on a price chart where significant trading activity has accumulated, often indicating trapped liquidity (e.g., stop-loss orders or pending orders)—combined with volatility filters to confirm genuine breakouts rather than false signals. The core premise is that breakouts from these clusters signal the release of pent-up liquidity, leading to accelerated price moves as market participants react. This strategy is best suited for intraday or swing trading on timeframes like 15-minute to 4-hour charts, focusing on liquid assets to ensure reliable volume data.

### Key Strategy Components
1. **Volume Clusters Identification**:
   - Use a Volume Profile indicator (or Volume at Price histogram) to detect clusters: These are horizontal bands where at least 70% of the session's or period's volume is concentrated within a narrow price range (e.g., 0.5-1% of the asset's average true range). Clusters often form at key levels like previous highs/lows, round numbers, or fair value gaps.
   - High-Probability Clusters: Prioritize "unresolved" clusters—areas with high volume but no immediate price reaction (e.g., volume spikes without follow-through), suggesting built-up liquidity waiting for a trigger.
   - Tool: Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) or Fixed Range Volume Profile on platforms like TradingView or MT5.

2. **Volatility Filters**:
   - Apply a volatility threshold to validate breakouts and avoid choppy markets. Use the Average True Range (ATR, 14-period) to measure expansion: A breakout is filtered in only if current ATR is at least 1.5x the 20-period average ATR, indicating increasing volatility.
   - Secondary Filter: Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 standard deviations) to confirm squeeze/expansion—enter only on band expansion after a period of contraction (bands narrowing to <1x ATR width).
   - Purpose: This ensures the breakout is fueled by genuine momentum rather than noise, reducing whipsaws in low-volatility regimes.

3. **Liquidity Breakout Confirmation**:
   - Liquidity refers to areas where stops or orders are clustered (e.g., above recent highs for shorts or below lows for longs). A breakout occurs when price closes beyond the cluster edge by at least 0.5x ATR, with accelerating volume (current bar volume > 1.5x 10-period average).

### Entry Rules
- **Long Entry (Bullish Breakout)**:
  - Identify a volume cluster acting as support (e.g., high-volume node below current price).
  - Wait for price to pull back to the cluster edge and then break above it (close > cluster high + 0.2% buffer to account for wicks).
  - Confirm with volatility filter: ATR expansion and volume surge on the breakout candle.
  - Additional Signal: Optional momentum confirmation via RSI (14-period) > 50 and rising, or a bullish engulfing candle.
  - Enter on the close of the breakout candle or a pullback to the cluster high (for better risk-reward).

- **Short Entry (Bearish Breakout)**:
  - Identify a volume cluster acting as resistance (e.g., high-volume node above current price).
  - Wait for price to rally to the cluster edge and then break below it (close < cluster low - 0.2% buffer).
  - Confirm with volatility filter: ATR expansion and volume surge on the breakout candle.
  - Additional Signal: RSI (14-period) < 50 and falling, or a bearish engulfing candle.
  - Enter on the close of the breakout candle or a pullback to the cluster low.

- **General Filters**:
  - Trade only during high-liquidity sessions (e.g., London/New York overlap for forex).
  - Avoid entries if the cluster is older than 5-10 bars (stale liquidity may not trigger).
  - Maximum 1-2 setups per day to prevent overtrading.

### Exit Rules
- **Profit Targets**:
  - Primary Target: Measure the cluster height (high to low) and project it from the breakout point (e.g., 1:1 or 1:2 risk-reward ratio). For longs, target the next resistance level or 1-2x cluster height.
  - Trailing Stop: Once price moves 1x ATR in favor, trail the stop using a 20-period EMA or ATR-based (e.g., 1x ATR below the EMA).
  - Partial Exits: Scale out 50% of position at 1:1 RR, let the rest run to 2:1 or until volatility contracts (ATR drops below 1x average).

- **Stop-Loss**:
  - Place initial stop 1x ATR below the cluster low (for longs) or above the cluster high (for shorts), ensuring it doesn't exceed 1-2% of account equity.
  - Hard Exit: If price re-enters the cluster (invalidates breakout) or RSI diverges (e.g., price makes new high but RSI fails to confirm).

- **Time-Based Exit**: Close all positions if no progress after 5-10 bars post-entry, or at session end to avoid overnight gaps.

### Risk Management
- **Position Sizing**: Risk no more than 1% of total account per trade. Calculate position size as: (Account Balance * 0.01) / (Entry Price - Stop-Loss Distance). For a $10,000 account and 50-pip stop, max position = $100 / (50 * pip value).
- **Maximum Exposure**: Limit to 3% total risk across open trades; no more than 2 concurrent positions.
- **Drawdown Controls**: Pause trading after 3 consecutive losses or 5% account drawdown. Use a volatility-adjusted lot size—reduce by 50% if ATR > 2x average (high vol increases risk).
- **Overall Guidelines**: Backtest on historical data (at least 1 year) using walk-forward optimization. Forward-test on demo for 1-3 months. Monitor win rate (target >55%) and profit factor (>1.5). Adjust cluster sensitivity based on asset (e.g., tighter for forex, wider for stocks).

### Required Indicators and Setup
- **Core Indicators**:
  - Volume Profile (VPVR or equivalent) for cluster detection.
  - ATR (14-period) for volatility measurement and stop/target sizing.
  - Bollinger Bands (20, 2) for squeeze/expansion filter.
- **Optional Enhancers**:
  - RSI (14) for momentum confirmation.
  - Volume Oscillator (e.g., On-Balance Volume or simple volume MA) to quantify surges.
- **Platform Recommendations**: TradingView (free VPVR), NinjaTrader, or Thinkorswim for advanced volume tools. Ensure real-time volume data for accuracy (e.g., via futures or tick volume for forex).
- **Data Requirements**: Tick or 1-minute data for precise clusters; apply on higher timeframes for confluence (e.g., daily clusters on H1 chart).

This strategy excels in trending markets with clear liquidity traps but may underperform in ranging conditions—always combine with market regime analysis (e.g., ADX >25 for trends).

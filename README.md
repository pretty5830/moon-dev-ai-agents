</p>

## 🎯 Vision
ai agents are clearly the future and the entire workforce will be replaced or atleast using ai agents. while i am a quant and building agents for algo trading i will be contributing to all different types of ai agent flows and placing all of the agents here for free, 100% open sourced because i beleive code is the great equalizer and we have never seen a regime shift like this so i need to get this code to the people

feel free to join [our discord](https://discord.gg/8UPuVZ53bh) if you beleive ai agents will be integrated into the workforce

- funding rate arbitrage agent (`fundingarb_agent.py`): tracks the funding rate on hyper liquid to find funding rate arbitrage opportunities between hl and solana
- rbi agent (`rbi_agent.py`): uses deepseek to research trading strategies based on the youtube video, pdf, or words you give it. then sends to his ai friend who codes out the backtest.
- twitter agent (`tweet_agent.py`): takes in text and creates tweets using deepseek or other models
- video agent (`video_agent.py`): takes in text to create videos by creating audio snippets using elevenlabs and combining with raw_video footage
- new or top tokens (`new_or_top_agent.py`): an agent that looks at the new tokens and the top tokens from coin gecko api

**PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:**

1. This is an experimental research project, NOT a trading system
2. There are NO plug-and-play solutions for guaranteed profits
3. We do NOT provide trading strategies
4. Success depends entirely on YOUR:
   - Trading strategy
   - Risk management
   - Market research
   - Testing and validation
   - Overall trading approach

5. NO AI agent can guarantee profitable trading
6. You MUST develop and validate your own trading approach

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

python 3.10.9 is what was used during dev

1. ⭐ **Star the Repo**
   - Click the star button to save it to your GitHub favorites

2. 🍴 **Fork the Repo**
   - Fork to your GitHub account to get your own copy
   - This lets you make changes and track updates

3. 💻 **Open in Your IDE**
   - Clone to your local machine
   - Recommended: Use [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) or [Windsurfer](https://codeium.com/) for AI-enabled coding

4. 🔑 **Set Environment Variables**
   - Check `.env.example` for required variables
   - Create a copy of above and name it `.env` file with your keys:
     - Anthropic API key
     - Other trading API keys
   - ⚠️ Never commit or share your API keys!

5. 🤖 **Customize Agent Prompts**
   - Navigate to `/agents` folder
   - Modify LLM prompts to fit your needs
   - Each agent has configurable parameters

6. 📈 **Implement Your Strategies**
   - Add your strategies to `/strategies` folder
   - Remember: Out-of-box code is NOT profitable
   - Thorough testing required before live trading

7. 🏃‍♂️ **Run the System**
   - Execute via `main.py`
   - Toggle agents on/off as needed
   - Monitor logs for performance

## 🌊 Swarm Trading System

The **Trading Agent** (`src/agents/trading_agent.py`) is a **fully self-contained, dual-mode AI trading system**.

### ⚙️ Configuration - All in One Place
**ALL settings are at the top of `src/agents/trading_agent.py` (lines 55-95)**

No need to edit multiple files - everything is configured in the trading agent itself:

```python
# 🌊 AI MODE (line 71)
USE_SWARM_MODE = True  # True = swarm, False = single model

# 📈 TRADING MODE (line 75)
LONG_ONLY = True  # True = Long positions only (Solana on-chain, no shorting)
                  # False = Long & Short (HyperLiquid perpetuals)

# 💰 POSITION SIZING (lines 93-96)
usd_size = 25                    # Target position size
max_usd_order_size = 3           # Order chunk size
MAX_POSITION_PERCENTAGE = 30     # Max % per position
CASH_PERCENTAGE = 20             # Min cash buffer

# 📊 MARKET DATA (lines 75-79)
DAYSBACK_4_DATA = 3              # Days of history
DATA_TIMEFRAME = '1H'            # Bar timeframe
# Options: 1m, 3m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1H, 2H, 4H, 6H, 8H, 12H, 1D, 3D, 1W, 1M

# 🎯 TOKENS (lines 93-96)
# ⚠️ ALL tokens in this list will be analyzed (one at a time)
MONITORED_TOKENS = [
    # '9BB6NFEcjBCtnNLFko2FqVQBq8HHM13kCyYcdQbgpump',  # FART (disabled)
    'DitHyRMQiSDhn5cnKMJV2CDDt6sVct96YrECiM49pump',     # housecoin (active)
]
```

**⚠️ Important:** The swarm analyzes **ALL tokens** in `MONITORED_TOKENS` one at a time. Each token takes ~60 seconds in swarm mode. Comment out tokens you don't want to trade by adding `#` at the start of the line.

### 🤖 Single Model Mode (Fast)
- Uses one AI model for quick trading decisions
- Response time: ~10 seconds per token
- Best for: Fast execution, high-frequency strategies
- Set `USE_SWARM_MODE = False` and configure `AI_MODEL_TYPE`

### 🌊 Swarm Mode (Consensus)
- Queries **6 AI models simultaneously** for consensus voting
- Response time: ~45-60 seconds per token
- Each model votes: **"Buy"**, **"Sell"**, or **"Do Nothing"**
- Majority decision wins with confidence percentage
- Best for: Higher confidence trades, 15-minute+ timeframes

**Trading Actions:**
- **"Buy"** = Bullish signal (open/maintain long position)
- **"Sell"** = Bearish signal (close long position)
- **"Do Nothing"** = Hold current position unchanged (no action taken)

**Trading Modes:**

Set `LONG_ONLY` to match your trading platform:

- **True (Solana On-Chain - Default):**
  - Long positions only (no shorting available)
  - **"Buy"** = Opens/maintains long position
  - **"Sell"** = Closes long position (exits to cash)
  - **"Sell" with no position** = Does nothing (can't short)
  - **Use case:** Spot trading on Solana, token trading

- **False (HyperLiquid Perpetuals):**
  - Long AND short positions available
  - **"Buy"** = Opens/maintains long position
  - **"Sell"** = Closes long OR opens short position
  - **"Sell" with no position** = Can open short
  - **Use case:** Perpetual futures on HyperLiquid

**Portfolio Allocation:**
- Automatically allocates capital when swarm recommends BUY signals
- Skipped when all signals are SELL or DO NOTHING
- Manages position sizing based on confidence levels

**Active Swarm Models:**
1. **Claude Sonnet 4.5** - Anthropic's latest reasoning model
2. **GPT-5** - OpenAI's most advanced model
3. **Gemini 2.5 Flash** - Google's fast multimodal model
4. **Grok-4 Fast Reasoning** - xAI's 2M context window model
5. **DeepSeek Chat** - DeepSeek API reasoning model
6. **DeepSeek-R1 Local** - Local reasoning model (free!)

**Example Swarm Output:**
```
🌊 Swarm Consensus: BUY with 83% agreement

Swarm Consensus (6 models voted):
  Buy: 5 votes
  Sell: 0 votes
  Do Nothing: 1 vote

Individual votes:
  - claude: Buy
  - openai: Buy
  - gemini: Buy
  - xai: Buy
  - deepseek: Buy
  - ollama: Do Nothing
```

**Market Data Details:**
- Current settings: 3 days @ 1H = **~72 bars per token**
- For 15-min bars: Change `DATA_TIMEFRAME = '15m'` = **~288 bars**
- Each query includes: Full OHLCV dataframe, strategy signals, token metadata

**How to Run:**
```bash
# Edit settings at top of file
vim src/agents/trading_agent.py  # Lines 55-95

# Run standalone
python src/agents/trading_agent.py

# Or via main orchestrator
python src/main.py  # Enable in ACTIVE_AGENTS
```
